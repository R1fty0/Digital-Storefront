    Current Tasks: 
    Tier 2:  Improve the reviewMyStuff() method, which pulls data from the list that contains all of the items you have bought, 
    to contain a lot more functionality. Instead of just reporting everything the user has bought all at once, provide a more customized experience that gives the user more choice and information when reviewing their stuff. 
    Hint: You may need to adjust how the userâ€™s bought items are stored and tracked to provide access to certain information. 	 	
    Tier 3: (viewCatalog) Provide the user another menu to choose which specific item they want to view more details about individually.
