    Current Tasks: 
    Tier 2:  Improve the reviewMyStuff() method, which pulls data from the list that contains all of the items you have bought, 
    to contain a lot more functionality. Instead of just reporting everything the user has bought all at once, provide a more customized experience that gives the user more choice and information when reviewing their stuff.
