Here is the list of everything I did in this project - I may have forgotten to note a few down.
- Added Computers to Store Inventory
- Fix Bank Account Issue where user was left with only 1 dollar in their bank account
- Added a menu where the user can view the items of a single category individually
- Improved the menu screen instruction display by adding all instruction into a list that is looped through to display the instructions
- Added the ability to for the user to view the 3 most recent purchases.
- Gave the user the option to view their most recent purchases (may add option to refund them)
- Text can be made and displayed with modularity
- Rewrote the Password logic to resolve verification error (this took way,way,way too long)
- Passwords can now be letters or words.
- Rewrote Inventory system and all supporting logic
- Combined the "makePurchaseFromShoppingCart" and "makePurchaseFromStore" functions so that one function can make purchases from both.
- Combined the "moveItemToShoppingCart" and "moveItemToUserInventory" so that items can moved to either the user's shopping cart or inventory depending on what destination is given.
- Gave the user the option of viewing each characteristic of each item in the catalog
- Gave the user the option of viewing item specifics for each item that they own.
- Enable the user to return the last 3 items they purchased.
